    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would advice them to make sure that they follow good web security practices. Such as firstly making sure that they sanitise their data by using a package such as the sanitise-html and use that in combination with the ORM library for SQL. They should also make sure that they have secure authorisation and authentication such as MS Authenticator or OneLogin. Another important aspect is to use well-known third-party application, and to do research before you choose one, such as looking at downloads per week. Furthermore, one can advice them to use continuous deployment as a security measure. This is because every change to the code gets run through security. Moreover I would advise them to choose a secure network. Lastly I would advice them to implement an automatic user timeout. I would do so because it will protect the users having left their credentials having too long in the browser. These are the steps I would dice the customer to take.]</p>
